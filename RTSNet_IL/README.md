**To run the Lorenz Attractor experiment using EKF or KalmanNet:**

1. Navigate to `RTSNet_batch_version`.
2. Open `main_lor_decimation.py`.
3. Uncomment the section for EKF or KalmanNet, depending on which algorithm you want to run.
4. Ensure that other algorithms, including any versions of RTSNet, are commented out.

**To run the Lorenz Attractor experiment using the Particle Filter (PF):**

1. Go to `RTSNet_original_version`.
2. Open `main_lor_decimation.py`.
3. Comment out all algorithms except for the Particle Filter.

**Data Handling:**
- The data can be regenerated, but it is not necessary for this run. Please ensure the data generation part remains commented out and use the load data function instead.
- The existing data can be found in `Simulations/Lorenz_Atractor/Data`.

**Enjoy running your experiments!**
